This repository provides example data and code relating to the paper entitled "Understanding and modelling the dynamics of data point clouds of relative growth rate and plant size" by Pommerening, Trincado, Salas-Eljatib and Burkhart in Forest Ecology and Management.

The data of example plot 410311 are provided in file "RadiataPineData.txt". The growth rates and mortality regression are coded in file "MortalityGD.R". The growth model parameters can be estimated with file "RGRmodellingParameterPrediction.R" and model simulations can be run using file "RGRmodel.R". All other files are auxiliary files.
